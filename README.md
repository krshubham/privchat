### Installation and running
I have used Babel for transpiling some ES6 features to ES5 code.
+ Make sure babel-cli is installed using ``` npm install -g babel-cli ```
+ ``` cd into/project/repo ```
+ ``` npm install ```
+ Run ``` npm run build ```
+ ``` cd frontend && npm install && npm run build ```
+ Go back into the root of the peoject repo and run ``` nodemon ./lib/app ```
+ The server will be running at localhost:8000
